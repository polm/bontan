# bontan

A program to generate html embeds from URLs. 

This just takes the URL, checks for a link to JSON OEmbed data, and pulls the
embeddable HTML out of that. That's simple but it works for YouTube, Vimeo, and
Twitter.

Currently there's no option to pass a width/height, but that should be added
soon.
